variables:
**********
-variables are used to store the data/ values /literals.

types of variables:
*******************
1.var:- re-initialization is possible
        re-declaration is possibe
2.let:- re-intitialization is possible
        re-decalration is not possible
3.const:- re-intitialization is not possible
        re-decalration is not  possible

ex:-   var username ="Bhavana";
    console.log(username);

here variable=var,
    identifier=username,
    value/data=Bhavana

    -extension of javascript file must be .js.
    In the browser if we want to run javascript file or css file we must connect those files with html file.
    html file is first file loaded in the browser
    DOCTYPE-
    http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html here 5500 port number -device location/address

    console.log():- it is a method to print the output in the developer console.
    document.writeln():- it is a method to print the output on the UI

what is comments?
comments are the ignored lined by the browser
to give information to the developer

two types of comments in js:
****************************
html:- <!--comment-->
css:- /* yujk*/
js:-
1.single line comment-(//)
2.multi line comment-(/**/)

what is data types?
-datatypes used to specify what kind of data stored in the variable.

types of datatypes:
*******************
1.primitive datatypes:- 
-they are built-in
-immutable
-they can store only single values
        -String,
        -number,
        -boolean,
        -undefined,
        -null
        -symbol
        -bigint

2.non-primitive datatypes:-
- they are user defined
- mutable
- they can store multiple values.
        -array
        -functions
        -objects
        -math, date, json

Strings:-
*********
-sequence of characters enclosed within "", '', ``(template literals/backtiks)

number:-
-   -2^53-1 to +2^53-1 upto this range we consider as number data type.
-beyond this range it will be bigint.

boolen:- true,false

undefined:- variable is declared but not initialized  with the value

null:- null is empty value/absence if an objects
-return type of null is 'object'

bigint:- any value exceed the range of number dattype we consider that as bigint.
- any value sufix with "n" will be bigint.

Operators:-
**************
- Operators is a special type of symbols used to perform some operations on operands.
ex - 10(operand1) +(operator) 20(operand2)

- unary
- binary
- ternary(operand1 ? operand2 : operand3)

1.arithmatic Operators
2.assignment operator
3.relational operator
4.logical operator

1.arithmatic Operators:-
- addition
- substraction
- multiplication
- division
- modulus
- expoenentail
- increment(++) :- increment will happen with one value
    - pre-increment :- increment before execution
    - post-increment :- increment after execution
- decrement(--) :- decrmenrted by 1
    - pre-decrement
    - post-decrement

concatenation :- adding two or more strings.
typecasting :- converting one datatype into another datatype.
NaN :- Not a Number :- 

2.assignment operator:-
- = , += , -= , *= ,/= , %= , **=

3.relational operator
- which are used to compare two values.
- == , === , != , !== , > , >= , < , <=
- returns always a boolean.
what is the difference between "==" and "==="?
-"==" - it will check only values not a data type.
-"===" - it will check both values and data types.
- "!=" - similar to == it will check only values not a data types
- "!==" - checks both value and data types.

4.Logical operators:-
AND(&&)- when both sides condition is true then it will return true else false.
OR(||) :- when both side is true or any one side is true it will return true else false.
NOT(!):- if true it becomes false and vice-versa. 

Decision making statments:-
****************************
-if:- it will work for true statments
- if else
- else if ladder
-switch
- ternary

prompt():- this method is used to collect the data from the users.

looping statments:-
*******************
-to execute the block of codes repeatedly
-for loop:-//entry controlled 
-will be used when the exact iteartion count ia known.
-minimum iteration count is 0
syntax:- for(initialization; condition; updation){
        //statments
        }

-while loop:-//entry controlled
-will be used when we dont know the iteartion count
-minimum iteration count is 0
syntax:- while(condition){
         //statments
         }

-do while loop:-//exit controlled 
will be used we dont know the iteartion count
-minimum iteration count is 1
syntax:- do{
          //statments
          }while(condition)

what are entry controlled and exit controlled loops?
-entry controlled loops: -for loop,while loop
-exit controlled loops:- -do while loop

-what is the difference between "break" and "continue" keywords.
break - when condition satisfied it will terminate the loop
permenently

continue-when the condition satisfies it will skip that particular
condition.

functions:-
************
- function is a block of code used to execute specific task assigned to it.
- function is a non-primitive data type.
- functions can be reusable.

syntax :-    function function_name(optional parameters){// function decalration
                    //statements
                    }
                function_name(arguments);

Types of functions:-
*********************
1.named function :- function which is having a name and invoked with the same name.
2.anonymus function :-function which doesnot have  a name to declare and to invoke.
3.function expression:- anonymus function decalration is assigned to a variable 
    and invoked with the same variable.
4.Immediate invoke function expression(IIFE):-
    - once the function is created immediatley it should be invoked.
    - it can be executed only once.

5.Arrow function:-it is used to concise the normal function syntax.
syntax :-  ()=>{};
- arrow function is similar to anonymus function.

6.higher order function:-
- higher order function is a function which accepts another function as a 
value/argument to its parameter and returns a functions as a output.

7.callback function:-
- callback function is a function which is passed as a value/argumnets to 
another function.

-closure :- closure is a memory created when functions bundled together/functions nested each other
        by giving accessibility to the innermost function to access the variables of outermost function.
 - closure is a memory which gives accessibility to access the variables of outermost function from innermost function.

Note:- 
current version of javascript - es14.
es - ECMA script 
ECMA - european computer manufacturing association

first name of java is oak
first name of javscript is livescript


return statement:-
- it will return either expression or variables to future use.

implicit return :- returns without using a "return" keyword manually.

explicit return :- returns using "return" keyword manually

Arrays:- 
********
- Array can store mulitple values within a single variable.
- collections of items / values.
- array can store homogenous values and heterogenous values.
syntax :-  [] 

ex :-  


map and forEach difference
map:- it is used to iterrate the values of an array one by one.
- it will return new Array from original array.

forEach :- it is sued to iterate the values of an array.
- if we return the value we will get "undefined".

methods in array:-
******************
push() , pop() , unshift() , shift() , reverse() , join()
concat()

what is object ?
- object is an entity which is used to store the values in the form of key &value pairs.
- Object is a physical entity which is having states(properties) and behaviours(method).

syntax :-  let obj = {};

notes: - Object based language  + OOPs

ex:-    let obj ={
                name:"Sam",
                age:25
                }

JSON :- Javascript object notation
- IT is used to transmit the data from client to server and server to client.

syntax :-  {
                "key":"value"
        }


- for json no need to store it inside variable
- both keys and values shoyuld be double quoted only except number.

ex:- {
    "name":"Sam",
    "age":25
}

extension for json file is ".json"

Arrays:-
********
- It is non-primitive data type
- It is a collection of elements / multiple values

map():- it is used to iterate values from the array.
if we return the value, map() method returns new copied array.

forEach():- it is used to 

what is object?
-Object is am entity which is having states(properties ) amd behaviours.
- Object is used r=to store the data in the form key & value pairs.
 syntax:- let obj={};

 JSON :- javaScript object notation.

 methids of json:-
 1.JSON.stringfy():-it is used to convert javascript object into json object.
 2.JSON.parse();- it is used to convert json object into javascript object.
